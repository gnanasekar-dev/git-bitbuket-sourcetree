This usage of git reset is a simple way to undo changes that haven’t been shared with anyone else. It’s your go-to command when you’ve
started working on a feature and find yourself thinking, “Oh crap, what am I doing? I should just start over.”

git checkout hotfix
git reset HEAD~2

git reset --mixed HEAD
git reset --hard HEAD

git reset --hard 202ca32
